## How to get the script

To get this script, please go to [our website](https://www.blueboxscripts.com/package/6855984) and retrieve it <b>FOR FREE</b>.
This script is free because it is the first ever script published by our group. Since removing NPCs is a much needed feature in most of the GTA RP servers, we decided to built this script as a gift to our future customers!

### Steps until it's installed

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="inbox" title="Check your email inbox">
   You'll receive an email from Tebex saying that the purchase package is available for download at cfx.re. Click the link and you'll be redirected to a page where you can download the asset that you just bought.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="upload" title="Upload the resource to your server">
    After the `bbx_npc_removal.zip` is downloaded, unzip it and move the folder to the `[resources]` folder inside your server files.

    After the folder is in the right directory, open your `server.cfg` file and look for a group of lines that starts with `ensure`. After the last line of that group, insert the following line of code:
    ```
      ensure bbx_npc_removal
    ```

    That should be enough to make the Bluebox NPC Removal script work. After adding that line, restart your server and you should see the script working (the streets should all be empty).
    <Note>
      This step is assuming that you already have a FiveM server set-up and ready to run. If you don't know how to create a FiveM server, we will upload a video to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@BlueBoxScripts) soon!
